## FAQ

## My SSD is a 2TB CingKo, is it wrong?

Not if it worksâ€¦

Basically, a handful of them failed and they seem to be too fast for being basically noname.

If it reports abnormal temps (often above 70 degrees) or simply dies on you, contact Ayaneo support (service@ayaneo.com), they might provide a replacement.

Note that Ayaneo are aware of this issue and we might get an update soon.

## Has my screen has lightbleed ?

Probably not. Stop taking pictures of your black screen at 100% brightness by night, youâ€™ll have a better time using [Dimmer](https://www.nelsonpires.com/software/dimmer) and playing.

If **then** you still notice an issue and it makes your experience worse, contact the support (service@ayaneo.com).
