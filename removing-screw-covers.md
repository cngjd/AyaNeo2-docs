## Safely removing screw covers during disassembly

When taking apart your Ayaneo 2, there are screw covers on either end that need to be removed. Best method to remove them without damaging them is to pick up an [iFixit toolkit](https://www.amazon.com/iFixit-Essential-Electronics-Toolkit-Smartphone/dp/B0964G2Y7S) that includes plastic iFixit Opening picks. Use the side of the pick (not the corner) to pry the bumper off and it should pop right off without damage. We do NOT recommend using the metal picks included with the Ayaneo 2 - they will damage the screw covers. 

From Ayaneo Discord user Wildfire, who discovered this method:

- See how I have the base of the pick in the seam? That causes just enough leverage / pressure to make it pop out after some tilting. Takes 1-3 tries. Dig the tip in and then slide the pick slow along the seam to get more surface area.
